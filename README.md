# Student-Performance-Analytics

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`EDU-Data.ipynb`) focused on exploring and analyzing educational datasets using Python. The project applies various data science and machine learning techniques to uncover insights and trends in education.

## Features

- Data cleaning and exploration of educational datasets
- Visualizations of key statistics and trends (bar charts, heatmaps, etc.)
- Analysis of student performance by demographic and institutional features
- Predictive modeling using machine learning (e.g., classification, regression)
- All graphs and outputs are visible directly in the notebook on GitHub
